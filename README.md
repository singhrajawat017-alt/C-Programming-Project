• A console-based movie ticket booking system for managing a single theater.

• Users can view all available seats, along with row number, seat number, and price.

• Booked tickets can be cancelled, and the system automatically calculates and shows the refund amount.

•The system tracks revenue separately for each movie, giving a clear picture of earnings.

• Every booking is saved to a file named bookings, txt, including customer details.

• Daily revenue details are stored in daily_records txt for record-keeping.

• Seating is categorized by comfort and price:

• Front rows: 1-3
